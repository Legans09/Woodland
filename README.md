This is a 2D Game that i've developed over the past few months using Unity and Photoshop.
also, this is the first time i've ever publish a piece of code on any Platform.

For Character graphic i've used this asset (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/free-spine-2d-character-animation-177560)
